✔️ Easy and fast to use<br />
✔️ Create, claim, reopen & close tickets<br />
✔️ Overview of team members who are online<br />
✔️ CAMI permissions<br />

## Installation
<ol>
<li>Download the repository and unpack it in the Addons folder.</li>
<li>Edit the sh_config.lua to your needs.</li>

## Permissions
As already mentioned, the addon uses CAMI permissions. That means you can adjust the permissions ingame with many admin mods.
In this example with SAM:
